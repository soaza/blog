## Ponte Luís I

Went to explore Porto after brunch, the Ponte Luis bridge is probably one of the most popular sites in Porto and its beautiful from its bridge structure to the views at the port nearby.

## Porto Cathedral

Went across the bridge and climbed up to the upper level of Porto to the Porto Cathedral.

Like all European churches the Cathedral was very well maintained. The paintings and structures were very intricate.

## Guindalense Football Club Bar

Probably one of my main highlight of the day was drink chilling at this bar that was recommmended by my Bnb Host.

Very affordable beer with sick views of the bridge.

## Dinner at Barris Do Douro Restaurante

Had dinner here which was quite touristy but the cod fish was very very nice.
