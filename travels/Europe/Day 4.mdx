title: Day 4 - Sintra

import Figure from "./figure";

Took a day trip to Sintra which was around 1 hour away from Lisbon

:::caution

I visited Sintra on a weekend which was crazy crowded so I only had time to visit 2 places which was pretty underwhelming and the weather was hot as well.

## Castelo dos Mouros

A Moorish castle built in the 10th century.

## Lunch at Bacalhau na Vila

Probably the highlight of my Sintra day trip. The seafood was so good and fresh but the portion was abit small.

## Dinner at Ramen Bambu Douradores

Some ramen in Lisbon, tasted different from normal ramen this was a bit spicy and can't taste the pork broth.
